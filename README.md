MCRAS â€“ Multi-Channel Recurrent Attention System (MCRAS)

OVERVIEW
MCRAS is a deep learning framework for multi-channel time-series data analysis.
It combines Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Attention mechanisms to model temporal and inter-channel dependencies.

FEATURES

Multi-Channel Input: Process multiple channels simultaneously

Recurrent Architecture: Capture temporal dependencies

Attention Mechanism: Focus on important channels and time steps

Scalable & Efficient: Handles large datasets effectively

INSTALLATION

# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Neon01602/MCRAS.git

# Step 2: Navigate into the folder
cd MCRAS

# Step 3: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


USAGE
Data Format:

Input: 3D tensor (num_samples, num_channels, num_timesteps)

Output: 2D tensor (num_samples, num_classes)

Model Initialization:
from mcras import MCRAS
model = MCRAS(input_size=128, hidden_size=64, num_channels=8, num_classes=10)

Training:
from mcras import train
train(model, train_loader, val_loader, epochs=50, lr=0.001)

Evaluation:
from mcras import evaluate
accuracy = evaluate(model, test_loader)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)

MODEL ARCHITECTURE

Input Layer: Accept multi-channel time-series

RNN Layers: Capture temporal dependencies

Attention Layer: Focus on important channels and time steps

Fully Connected Layer: Output classes prediction

TRAINING WORKFLOW

Load datasets (train & validation)

Initialize MCRAS model

Choose loss function: Cross-Entropy

Optimizer: Adam with learning rate scheduler

Training loop: Update weights per epoch

EVALUATION

Evaluate performance on test dataset:
accuracy = evaluate(model, test_loader)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
